## EZFinance

### Inspiration
We were considering the dual questions of financial literacy and digital banking, and decided to combine the two so we could make it easier for people like us (students) or people without education in finance to get started investing.

### What it does
Serves as an online banking platform, and also displays short-term investments (with breakouts listed for easy access) as well as long-term investment opportunities. Additionally, links to a community forum and other resources, and displays financial news.

### How we built it
We used Flask to set up the server, and HTML/CSS/JS for the website display. Python was used to fetch data from various APIs and format it.

### Challenges we ran into
Linking the Python data to the website UI, and fetching reliable data from Yahoo Finance.
